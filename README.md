# A-visualization-of-Introduction-to-Manual-Photography

Our project aims to create a clear and easy to understand visualization for photography beginners to learn how to manually adjust the four main functions of a digital camera, including aperture, shutter speed, ISO, and exposure. By using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, we design an interactive instruction to help beginners pick up the basic photography skills quickly.
